## Linear Regression
#### What is Linear Regression

Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It assumes a linear relationship between the variables, making it suitable for predicting continuous outcomes, such as sales figures or temperature readings.

## Logistic Regression
#### What is Logistic Regression

Logistic regression is a statistical method used for binary classification tasks, like predicting yes or no outcomes. It calculates the probability of an event occurring based on input features, making it suitable for predicting categorical outcomes in various fields like healthcare, marketing, and finance.

## Model Comparison and Selection
#### Linear Regression vs Logistic Regression Model

Linear Regression is great for predicting continuous values such as house prices or temperature. It is evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) or R-squared Score. On the other hand, Logistic Regression is perfect for binary classification tasks like spam detection or medical diagnosis. It is assessed using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Each model is suitable for different prediction problems based on the type of outcome variable: linear for continuous outcomes and logistic for binary outcomes.

## Conclusion
This webpage consists of the activities and knowledge we had during the midterm semester of 2023-2024. Thus, studying the subject of “CSEL 302: Introduction to Intelligent Systems” has served as a tool for getting into the world of AI and data analysis using Python programming language in Google Colab. As a result, I’ve learned how to tackle real-world problems like predicting outcomes and understanding trends through linear and logistic regression, which feels like stepping into the future of technology right from my computer devices.
