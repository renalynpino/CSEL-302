# Activities Compilation

### Introduction

Welcome to my compilation of activities in CSEl - 302. This subject course entitled "Introduction to Intelligent Systems" course introduces students to core concepts in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data analysis. Its objectives include fostering the ability to design intelligent systems and critically evaluate their impact on society and ethical considerations.

### Linear Regression

Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It assumes a linear relationship between the variables, making it suitable for predicting continuous outcomes, such as sales figures or temperature readings.

### Logistic Regression

Logistic regression is a statistical method used for binary classification tasks, like predicting yes or no outcomes. It calculates the probability of an event occurring based on input features, making it suitable for predicting categorical outcomes in various fields like healthcare, marketing, and finance.

### Linear Regression vs. Logistic Regression (Model Comparison and Selection)

Linear Regression is great for predicting continuous values such as house prices or temperature. It is evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) or R-squared Score. On the other hand, Logistic Regression is perfect for binary classification tasks like spam detection or medical diagnosis. It is assessed using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Each model is suitable for different prediction problems based on the type of outcome variable: linear for continuous outcomes and logistic for binary outcomes.
